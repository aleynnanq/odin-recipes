    <p>
      Puerto Rican pollo guisado is a comforting, slow-simmered chicken stew
      that embodies the bold and vibrant flavors of the island’s cuisine.
      Bone-in chicken pieces are braised in a rich, tomato-based sauce infused
      with sofrito—a fragrant blend of onions, garlic, bell peppers, and
      culantro or cilantro. The dish is seasoned with traditional spices like
      adobo, sazón, oregano, and bay leaves, creating a deep, savory flavor.
      Tender potatoes and carrots soak up the flavorful broth, making it a
      hearty one-pot meal that’s both filling and satisfying. Some variations
      also include olives or capers for a briny contrast that enhances the
      dish’s complexity.

      Served over fluffy white rice, pollo guisado is a staple in Puerto Rican
      households, often enjoyed as a comforting, home-cooked meal shared with
      family. The slow cooking process allows the flavors to meld together,
      resulting in tender chicken that falls off the bone and a thick, velvety
      sauce that coats every bite. While the ingredients are simple and humble,
      the combination of fresh aromatics and traditional seasonings makes this
      dish a standout in Puerto Rican cuisine. Whether eaten on a weeknight or
      as part of a celebratory feast, pollo guisado is a dish that represents
      warmth, tradition, and the island’s love for flavorful, homey meals.

      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small onion chopped</li>
      <li>1 small bell pepper chopped (or use hotter peppers to your taste)</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sofrito</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olives</li>
      <li>3 medium potatoes halved and quartered</li>
      <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
      <li>8 ounces tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the chicken with adobo and sazon seasoning. Be sure to get all
        sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the
        chicken and cook for 10 minutes to brown all sides, flipping half way
        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic and sofrito. Stir and cook for 3-4
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the olives, potatoes, bay leaves, tomato sauce and chicken broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer for 30
        minutes, or until the chicken is tender and fall-off-the-bone. It should
        register 165 degrees internal (minimum) when measured with a food
        thermometer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with red pepper flakes and fresh chopped parsley and serve.
