      Pernil without arroz con gandules is like turkey without stuffing—the
      arroz completes any holiday meal in the Greater Antilles (especially
      Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic). This Puerto Rican version
      uses many of the same ingredients from our pernil, with the addition of
      smoked ham hock. If you have more time, keep the ham hock simmering for
      another hour or longer for even more flavor and super-tender meat. We call
      for canned gandules because they’re easier to find, but if you can find
      frozen, use those; they will have better flavor and texture. Simply let
      them thaw before proceeding.

    <p>
      Arroz con gandules is Puerto Rico’s quintessential rice dish, often served
      during holidays, celebrations, and family gatherings. This flavorful
      one-pot meal combines long-grain rice with gandules (pigeon peas) and a
      fragrant sofrito base made from onions, garlic, bell peppers, and herbs.
      The dish is seasoned with sazón, adobo, and sometimes a touch of cumin or
      smoked paprika, giving it a signature golden hue and deep, savory flavor.
      Traditionally, it’s cooked in a large caldero (a heavy-bottomed pot),
      which helps create the beloved pegao—a crispy layer of rice at the bottom
      that adds texture and richness to every bite.

      Often served alongside pernil (slow-roasted pork) or pollo guisado (stewed
      chicken), arroz con gandules is a staple of Puerto Rican cuisine,
      embodying the island’s love for hearty, well-seasoned food. Some
      variations include olives, capers, or bits of salted pork for an extra
      layer of briny, savory complexity. The combination of aromatic spices,
      tender rice, and earthy pigeon peas makes this dish both comforting and
      deeply flavorful. More than just a side, arroz con gandules represents
      Puerto Rican culture and tradition, bringing families together over plates
      filled with warmth and history.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ripe plum tomatoes, cored, coarsely chopped (about 1½ cups)</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>
        2 Cubanelle peppers, seeds removed, coarsely chopped (about 1 cup)
      </li>
      <li>
        1 medium red bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, coarsely chopped
        (about 1 cup)
      </li>
      <li>1 large bunch cilantro, coarsely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
      <li>1 head of garlic, cloves separated, peeled</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring ham hock and stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan over
        medium-low heat, cover, and cook until ham hock is tender, at least 1
        hour or up to 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Cook reserved 1 cup
        sofrito, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown and most of the
        liquid is evaporated, 5–8 minutes. Add Sazón, salt, and pepper and cook,
        stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add rice and olives,
        pimientos, and capers and cook, stirring often, until some grains are
        translucent, about 3 minutes. Add ham hock and stock (you should have 3
        cups; if not, add water or more stock to get you there). Scatter pigeon
        peas over. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover
        saucepan and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20–30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pan from heat, transfer ham hock to a plate, and fluff rice with
        a fork. Cover pan and let sit 15 minutes. Shred meat from ham hock,
        cover loosely, and let sit until ready to serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer rice to a platter. Top with reserved ham hock and cilantro.
