    <h2>
      Churrasco, a Portuguese term for grilled meat, is a backbone of many Latin
      American cuisines.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Churrasco con salsa chimichurri is a beloved Latin American dish featuring
      a perfectly grilled skirt steak paired with a vibrant, herbaceous
      chimichurri sauce. The steak is typically marinated with garlic, citrus,
      and spices before being seared over high heat to achieve a smoky, charred
      crust while remaining tender and juicy inside. The cut’s natural marbling
      enhances its rich, beefy flavor, making it an ideal match for the bold,
      tangy notes of chimichurri. This sauce, a staple in Argentinian and Puerto
      Rican cuisine, is made with fresh parsley, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, and
      a touch of red pepper flakes, creating a zesty, garlicky contrast that
      cuts through the richness of the meat.

      In Puerto Rican cuisine, churrasco con salsa chimichurri is often served
      with classic sides like arroz con habichuelas (rice and beans), tostones
      (fried plantains), or yuca al mojo (cassava with garlic sauce). The
      combination of smoky grilled steak and the fresh, tangy bite of
      chimichurri makes for a well-balanced and deeply satisfying meal. Whether
      enjoyed at a family gathering, a casual roadside lechonera, or a high-end
      restaurant, this dish highlights the love for bold flavors and
      high-quality ingredients that define Puerto Rican and Latin American
      culinary traditions.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 bunches curly parsley (8 ounces), thick stems discarded</li>
      <li>1/3 cup garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 pounds trimmed center-cut beef tenderloin</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a food processor, combine the parsley and garlic with the 3/4 cup of
        olive oil and the vinegar and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate the
        chimichurri for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a sharp chef’s knife, make a 1/4-inch, lengthwise cut in the top
        of the tenderloin. Turning the tenderloin and rolling it out as you go,
        spiral-cut the meat until you have a long, rectangular piece about 1/4
        inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic and sofrito. Stir and cook for 3-4
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the olives, potatoes, bay leaves, tomato sauce and chicken broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Light a grill. Season both sides of the tenderloin with salt and pepper.
        Rub all but one-third of the chimichurri over the meat and grill over
        moderately high heat, turning once, about 4 minutes for medium-rare
        meat; let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix the remaining chimichurri and olive oil.
        Season with salt and pepper and serve with the steak.
      </li>
